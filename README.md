## Quickstart

We recommend creating a virtual environment, but this is completely optional:

```bash
cd /tmp
mkdir brokenspoke-analyzer
cd brokenspoke-analyzer
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the application using `pip`:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/PeopleForBikes/brokenspoke-analyzer@2.0.0-rc
```

The simplest way to run an analysis is to use docker compose.

```bash
bna run-with compose usa "santa rosa" "new mexico" 3570670
```

This command takes care of starting and stopping the PostgreSQL/PostGIS server,
running all the analysis commands and exporting the results.

The data required to perform the analysis will be saved in
`data/santa-rosa-new-mexico-usa`, and the results exported in
`data/santa-rosa-new-mexico-usa/results/usa/new mexico/santa rosa/`

For more details about the different ways to run an analysis and how to adjust
the options, please refer to full documentation.
