Prepare
-------

The ``prepare`` subcommand is in charge of collecting and preparing the files
required to run an analysis.

Usage
^^^^^

.. program:: bna

.. option:: bna prepare COUNTRY CITY [STATE] [OUTPUT_DIR]

- **COUNTRY**: the name of the country or a specific region available as an OSM
  dataset. See the :ref:`datasets` page for more information.
- **CITY**: the full name of the city (e.g "flagstaff", "san antonio"). It is
  case insensitive and must be quoted if there are spaces.
- **STATE**: Only useful for US cities. It may generate incorrect results when
  used for other countries.
- **OUTPUT_DIR**: the last parameter and is an optional path to indicate where
  to store the results on disk.

Example: a US city::

  bna prepare usa flagstaff arizona
  # Or simpler
  bna prepare arizona flagstaff

Example: a non-US city::

  bna prepare spain valencia

Example: a non-US city with a specific region::

  bna prepare paris paris



Analyze
-------

The ``analyze`` subcommand will comsume the artifacts being generated by the
``prepare`` subcommand and start an analysis.

Usage
^^^^^

.. program:: bna

.. option:: bna analyze STATE CITY_SHP PFB_OSM_FILE [OUTPUT_DIR]

- **STATE**: the full name of the state (e.g "arizona", "new mexico"). It is
  case insensitive and must be quoted if there are spaces.
- **CITY_SHP**: the shapefile repesenting the city boundaries.
- **PFB_OSM_FILE**: the OSM file representing the city.
- **OUTPUT_DIR**: is the last parameter and is an optional path to indicate where
  to store the results on disk.

Example::

  bna analyze arizona flagstaff flagstaff.shp flagstaff-arizona.osm

The syntax is identical to the :ref:`prepare` command.
