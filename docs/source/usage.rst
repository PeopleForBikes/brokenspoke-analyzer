General
-------

.. program:: bna

.. option:: bna [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

This section describes the options that can be added on the CLI to alter some
default behaviors of the commands.

.. note::

  The "OPTIONS" must always be placed between `bna` and the command to execute.

Verbosity
^^^^^^^^^

The verbosity level can be adjusted by adding or removing `-v` flags.

- None  : Initial log level is WARNING.
- `-v`  : INFO
- `-vv` : DEBUG
- `-vvv`: TRACE

Example: start a BNA run with the log level set to "TRACE"::

  bna -vvv run arizona flagstaff

.. _prepare:

Prepare
-------

The ``prepare`` subcommand is in charge of collecting and preparing the files
required to run an analysis.

Usage
^^^^^

.. program:: bna

.. option:: bna prepare COUNTRY CITY [STATE] [OUTPUT_DIR]

- **COUNTRY**: the name of the country or a specific region available as an OSM
  dataset. See the :ref:`datasets` page for more information.
- **CITY**: the full name of the city (e.g "flagstaff", "san antonio"). It is
  case insensitive and must be quoted if there are spaces.
- **STATE**: Only useful for US cities. It may generate incorrect results when
  used for other countries.
- **OUTPUT_DIR**: the last parameter and is an optional path to indicate where
  to store the results on disk.

Example: a US city::

  bna prepare usa flagstaff arizona
  # Or simpler
  bna prepare arizona flagstaff

Example: a non-US city::

  bna prepare spain valencia

Example: a non-US city with a specific region::

  bna prepare paris paris


Analyze
-------

The ``analyze`` subcommand will comsume the artifacts being generated by the
``prepare`` subcommand and start an analysis.

Usage
^^^^^

.. program:: bna

.. option:: bna analyze STATE CITY_SHP PFB_OSM_FILE [OUTPUT_DIR]

- **STATE**: the full name of the state (e.g "arizona", "new mexico"). It is
  case insensitive and must be quoted if there are spaces.
- **CITY_SHP**: the shapefile repesenting the city boundaries.
- **PFB_OSM_FILE**: the OSM file representing the city.
- **OUTPUT_DIR**: is the last parameter and is an optional path to indicate where
  to store the results on disk.

Example::

  bna analyze arizona flagstaff flagstaff.shp flagstaff-arizona.osm

Run
---

The ``run`` subcommand is a combination of ``prepare`` and ``analyze``.

The syntax is identical to the :ref:`prepare` command.

Usage
^^^^^

.. program:: bna

.. option:: bna run COUNTRY CITY [STATE] [OUTPUT_DIR]

Example::

  bna run arizona flagstaff
