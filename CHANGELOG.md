## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - 2022-08-14

First stable version.

[1.0.0]:
  https://github.com/PeopleForBikes/brokenspoke-analyzer/releases/tag/1.0.0

## [1.0.0-rc.1] - 2022-08-07

This is the first usable release. It is possible to run analysis for any city in
the world (although the analyzer will fail for some of them).

The tool is still a bit rough on the edges, that is why this is a release
candidate, but the quirks will be ironned out for 1.0.0.
