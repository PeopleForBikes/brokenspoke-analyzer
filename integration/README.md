## Runinng the tests

### Batches

The test suites can either be ran in full (although it would take days to
complete...) or it can use the files partitioned by test sizes (e.g.
`e2e-cities-xs.csv).

```bash
uv run python utils/bna-batch.py e2e-cities-xs.csv
```

Specifying the analysis part to only be `measure` significantly speeds up the
tests while running through the full process:

```bash
uv run python utils/bna-batch.py --with-parts measure e2e-cities-xs.csv
```

### Individual

To run tests individualy we recommend using the `run-with compose` command.

Export the `DATABASE_URL`:

```bash
export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres
```

Here is the list of commands for all the test cities:

```bash
uv run bna run-with compose "australia" "orange" "australia"
uv run bna run-with compose "canada" "ancienne-lorette" "québec"
uv run bna run-with compose "france" "chambéry" "rhone-alpes"
uv run bna run-with compose "spain" "valencia" "valencia"
uv run bna run-with compose "united states" "flagstaff" "arizona" 0423620

uv run bna run-with compose "united states" "san juan" "puerto rico" 7276770
uv run bna run-with compose "united states" "alvarado" "texas" 4802260
uv run bna run-with compose "united states" "jackson" "wyoming" 5640120

```

## Updating the tests

If tests need to be updated or added, the master file is `e2e-cities.csv`. This
is the entrypoint used for generating this file and the batch test files.

The `Justfile` contains tasks to do so easily. It requires the [xan] tool to be
installed locally.

[xan]: https://github.com/medialab/xan/

## JSON input

This is mostly used for validatin our AWS pipeline since the list of cities to
get processed is sent to AWS SQS in JSON format.

SQS requires the input to be passed as JSON. For this reason, the CSV test file
is being exported to JSON as well. Look for the `e2e-cities.json` file in this
folder.

## Adding more tests

Simply edit the `e2e-cities.csv` file and run the `just test-e2e-prepare`
command.
